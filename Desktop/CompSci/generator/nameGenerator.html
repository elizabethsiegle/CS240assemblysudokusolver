<!-- I have weird texting, so was unable to gain access to Twitter API to pull Trump's Tweets--so these are hardcoded. Once I do get access to the API, won't use hard-coded quotes+Tweets, and will also work on a TwitterBot. -->

			"I will build a great wall--and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me-â€”and I&#39;ll build them very inexpensively. I will build a great, great wall on our southern border, and I will make Mexico pay for that wall. Mark my words." ,
			"When Mexico sends its people, they&#39;re not sending the best. They&#39;re not sending you, they&#39;re sending people that have lots of problems and they&#39;re bringing those problems with us.
