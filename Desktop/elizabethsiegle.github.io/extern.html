                    <p>
After externing, shadowing, listening, and learning, I flew back to school inspired, invigorated, and enthusiastic. </p>
<p>
What is an extern? Over Winter and Spring Breaks, Bryn Mawr and Haverford alums may offer to host current students, and the students “shadow” them at their workplace. I have a friend from San Jose who went to Alaska to extern with a veterinarian. A guy from my Linguistics course externed with a Rabbi. Me? I externed with a BMC alumna, Susan Morrow, in Oakland. She is the co-founder and VP of Product at One University Network, a start-up that provides college degrees via a mobile app. </p>
<p>
Going in, I wasn’t sure what to expect. The startup had grown rapidly, in office space as well as number of people. I shadowed Susan’s meetings, where she did a bit of everything. She had to understand the engineering side, the design side, as well as the marketing side. I became interested in UX Design at Shriya’s workshop at She++ Code Day a few days before, and enjoyed learning from the design team about what software they used, their processes, and what a designer should know and do. </p>
<p>
There was so much vocabulary and terminology I did not know or understand, so I Googled a lot. There were the Five P’s of Marketing, Balsamiq, the difference between a prototype, a mockup, and a wireframe, and more. I learned that I think I would prefer to work at a startup compared to a bigger company. I liked how everyone was close and knew each other, and there was a huge feeling of trust among everyone. I liked how many people wore different hats. In a way, I likened it to being like Bryn Mawr in those regards. </p>
<p>
From the engineering team, I kind of listened to and followed along as they discussed what they were doing individually and as a team with Twilio, a REST API, and on the Android side. It was comforting in a way to see that they spent a lot of time Googling and Stack Overflowing, and planning and learning what they had to do. Jorge was a Physics major, but attended a coding boot camp, so he brought an interesting perspective. I liked what Nick had to say about working as a software engineer on the Minerva Project, and how that was education-related, too. Ben was the Android guy, so I was very interested in what he was doing on the mobile side. Though I’ve visited many tech companies, I didn’t realize how an engineering team really worked, and how all the other teams came together. </p>
<p>
The highlight, however, was Susan. She is what I imagine an alumna of a women’s college to be — confident, fun, smart, witty, and personable. She understands people, makes everyone feel like they belong and bring something to the table, but also brings the best out of them. She understood me too, and at the end of the week, she recommended I look into Hack the Hood and Black Girls Code, who were in One University’s previous workspace, as places to work at over the summer. </p>
<p>
The whole externship seemed like a preview of the summer. I stayed with my grandmother in the condo that has been in the family for almost 30 years, located in Lower Pacific Heights. She woke me up before 7 AM, and thought I should be in bed before 9:30 PM. She got me bao from Chinatown for breakfast, and thought it was weird when I showered each night (I walked 35 minutes both ways down California St. to get to and from Embarcadero BART Station, and the hills coming back up were killerrrrr!) And yet I felt so grown-up, walking to and from BART with my laptop bag, among so many working professionals. I walked past Trader Joe’s, Nob Hill, Grace Cathedral, Chinatown, and the Financial District, alongside the Cable Car tracks.
Thync, a new wearable tech, hosted a $5 Soul Cycle night at the SoMa location (but it wasn’t truly in SoMa — I felt extremely safe, albeit out of place among young, beautiful women clad head-to-toe in Lululemon) and I jumped at the chance to attend. Boy, was it was an experience! I wouldn’t pay full price ever, but it was fun and I did feel pushed. </p>
<p>
I look forward to this semester now, where I am interning with a local Philly startup working on their iOS app. I’m planning on taking one CS course, and three Humanities ones — after the stress of last semester, it should be fairly fun. (It’ll be alright — I’m ahead in the major plan!) Tennis season is coming up, and I’ll be home in the Bay for a few days for the She++ Ambassadors Summit and Gala! After seeing Susan, I know that though college is tough, I’m tougher, and I’ll be stronger at the end. Though I don’t have set summer plans yet, I know I will have options — and I can’t wait to visit Oakland again (I’d never been there that much, though I have cousins who live there and my mom grew up there) to see Susan and the rest of One University after their launch. </p>
