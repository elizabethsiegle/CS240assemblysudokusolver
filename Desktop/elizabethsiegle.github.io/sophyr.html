                    <p>It's been a tough year, I'm not going to sugarcoat it. I cried, I didn't sleep, and yet I also laughed, played, and ran around. I coded, wrote papers, learned a lot, and strengthened (and lost) friendships. </p>

                    <p>I realized that that's college. That's life. As one of my professors put it plainly, I didn't come to Bryn Mawr expecting it to be easy. I didn't expect computer science to be easy. I went through a short period of self-pity, but my doubles partner and a few other friends and classmates snapped me out of it. There are so many others taking the same classes (and more), working the same job (and others), and more. I'm not alone. </p>
                    <p>That's the thing about women's colleges. It's uniting and it's empowering. It's comforting to know that you're not alone, and that you have this huge support system and network of students, professors, and alumnae behind you. I'm looking forward to SnapChatting with everyone when we're apart this summer, and also meeting up with my Extern host, Susan, for coffee sometime around Oakland or SF! </p>

                    <p>Though it was tough academically, I learned a lot. I grew a lot in CS, socially, tennis-wise, and as a person. Now, I drink coffee. The taste is acquired, but it's not bad. There was a month and a half period where I drank three cups a day! I had three all-nighters, and got less sleep than ever before, but hey, it builds character. I also now watch Korean Dramas, which, though I thought were weird at first, are addicting and funny. Dramas aside, in the other ways I changed, I feel stronger, more confident, and also ready to learn more because I know there's still so much to learn and do!</p>

                    <p>Tennis was a highlight of this year. Our new coach was great, and the seniors couldn't have been better. We got so close, bonding on long bus rides, on the Spring Break trip to Florida, in Romance to Bromance, over movie nights, and more. Before, I didn't really enjoy playing doubles. I never really played it after freshman year of high school, and though I watched some doubles, never really picked up on the strategies. It took time, but Melina (my partner) and I grew, and we were winning and putting up fights. We made first-team at the Seven Sisters tournament at Vassar in April, winning 2/3 matches, one of which was a three-setter versus Mount Holyoke. It was our last match that was my favorite. Our college president, who had been a student-athlete during her undergrad years at Swarthmore, attended. We were down 4-7 (in an 8-game pro-set), and won the next four games to win! I wish she wasn't graduating because we gelled on and off court, and I wouldn't have improved that much without her support, but she will be on the West Coast for grad school, which is neat, of course. Each senior was different, but they inspired us all in their own ways. We'll definitely keep in touch, and I'm excited to see the new freshmen next year.</p>
                    
                    <p> Socially, it was tough sometimes to make the time. I grew a lot closer with classmates, united by our pain and suffering. I also grew closer to some teammates, some coworkers, and others, and am sad that some are studying abroad next year! I sometimes wish I, too, was going abroad, but my mom is right in saying that I would not study as much abroad. I hope to take a class at Swarthmore at Penn instead. </p>

                    <p> Being a <a href = "sheplusplus.org">She++</a> Ambassador was a highlight of the year, too. I loved organizng Code Day, the trip to NYC, and coming back for the summit and Gala. I met amazing people, got closer to others, made great connections, and learned so much. (I say that a lot, but hey, it's true!) </p>

                    <p>I can't believe I'm half-way done with college. The second semester went by so much faster than the first, and I'm excited for summer and then junior year. </p>
