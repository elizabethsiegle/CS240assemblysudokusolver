                <p>This is the second year in a row that Bryn Mawr College has canceled classes for a day to host a series of talks and workshops addressing social topics— last year was race, and this year was class. Though I lazily skipped last year, this time around, I realized there was a reason classes were canceled — these topics that were discussed are important.
                </p>
                <p>
I attended a discussion titled something along the lines of Model Minority and Class. The topic really resonated me because of racial stereotypes regarding class, and I think race and class overlap a lot.
I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again — I am half-Chinese(-American) and half Russian-Polish. I almost wrote a college essay on being called “exotic” and on being constantly asked, “What are you?” because it’s peculiar how I’m treated differently when people don’t know my ethnic background. This ethnic ambiguity where I can pass for Latina helped when I TA’d for an algebra class in East Palo Alto this past summer — I think I connected and reached students easier by looking like them more. One downside to this is when people feel bad for mistaking my ethnicity because once they find out I’m Chinese, they think I’m smarter. I’m not offended if you think I’m Filipina or African American — it’s happened before, and when I look in the mirror, sometimes I question it, too. It’s that social stigma and stereotype that some races are superior (ie. model minority) that bothers me. </p>
<p>
I’ve met people of all backgrounds who are smart, hardworking, and passionate. They’ve inspired and empowered me to work harder and do more. When people apologize, it’s like they look down upon other backgrounds. This was a big part of the discussion today — how society views different minorities, and how the term “Asian” is so broad. What many don’t realize is that the Hmong and Cambodians, who are clearly Asian, have some of the highest high school drop out rates. More should be done to help these minorities instead of lumping them in with the ones we consider model. A video was shown talking about how just because you have nice things doesn’t mean you’re well-to-do. People struggle for belongings like smart phones. People live in expensive areas for the ethnic community or family, or for the schools. They live in small rooms or with non-nuclear-family-members to save money. Most of all, people don’t talk about how people make their money (if they have it.) The student leading the discussion today talked about how people assume her father, an Indian immigrant, was an engineer, when he in fact worked manual labor, saving up everything he could to move to America. </p>
<p>
Being considered (but not necessarily looking like) that “model minority,” I really identified with how that concept (model minority) is internalized. I’m fourth-generation San Franciscan. I know that I grew up privileged, but those that came before me (mom, grandparents, great-grandparents) did not. The San Francisco Bay Area they knew or know is not the San Francisco Bay Area of today. They toiled away, making sacrifices so their children could have better lives and jobs than they did. I believe my great-grandfather worked in a restaurant or doing laundry for railroad workers. My grandmother and grandfather raised my mom and her sister in Oakland, where they were called “Chinks.” I’ve heard stories of my mom and aunt’s high school days at Oakland Tech where girls pulled knives in the bathroom, bags were stolen, and students got beaten up. At my high school, though it used to have that more (it used to be predominately African American, but now it’s predominately Latino with a high percentage of Asians), its image has changed drastically. The first day freshman year, some middle school friends (our middle school was predominately White, Asian, and sheltered) and I stood huddled, scared. When I left, that was most definitely not the case. </p>
<p>
In Asian/Asian-American culture, family is extremely important — and I (I admit, I identify more with my Asian side as I grew up around my Asian family in a very diverse area) feel that I have carried (and continue to do so) my family with me. When I study, and learn, I do it partially for my grandmother. She was orphaned early on, grew up in a tiny apartment above a restaurant with her three sisters, and was the only one of them to finish high school (because her eldest sister sacrificed so much for her to do so.) My grandfather came here when he was around 14, and for his whole life, did not speak much because he was ashamed of his accent. I am much more welcoming and sensitive to accents after hearing my mom mention this. He was smart, however — he worked as a mechanic in WW2, and I am so, so, so proud of he (and my grandmother) for working hard and saving a lot of money so they and my family could be comfortable later on.
And yet, though I respect, appreciate, and love my family, it’s a lot of pressure to carry. It’s a lot of pressure to know where I came from and what others before me went through. It’s a lot of pressure to look around and see others from the same ethnic background doing better than you in school, sports, in whatever. It’s a lot of pressure to note that you don’t look like others from that background. There’s a reason why there have been so many suicides in Palo Alto and the Bay Area in general — mental health among these “model minorities” has not been prioritized, let alone properly addressed. </p>
<p>
I’m not saying I had it tough. I was stressed because of pressure to live up to expectations (both of my parents were successful business-wise, and attended top colleges.) Children of immigrants feel this tenfold, on a much greater scale, because they have more to lose. I had a friend in high school who was doing taxes, scheduling doctor appointments for herself, her parents, and her younger brother, and fielding phone calls and emails, acting as her parents for her whole family because they didn’t speak English. She was so much more mature than I was, and it inspired me greatly to take on more responsibilities. I noted how different I was compared to my friends who were first-generation-American-born, or who had moved here when they were young. Honestly, they worked harder than I did in school, and pushed me to be more like them in a way. I volunteered, played more sports, and worked more jobs than they did because though education was a priority in my household, my parents also emphasized more of the well-rounded education.</p>
<p>
I’ve been working on and off since middle school. I was a youth baseball and softball umpire, and I worked the most games out of all of the umpires for two seasons. I got a job sophomore year of high school, quitting basketball and softball in the process, to make more money on the side. I babysat, tutored, and coached tennis in the summer as well as during the school year. The summer after high school, I worked in a restaurant as well as at the library. I learned so much by working a cash register and talking to customers. Though my brother did not like his customer service experience when he worked at Staples last summer, I found that I was treated well in downtown San Mateo come lunchtime. Some customers that I spoke to at the restaurant helped inspire me to learn programming that summer (there are quite a few startups there) and I also enjoyed seeing high school and middle school classmates come in. Being busy has always helped me maximize my time, be more efficient, and, in a way, get more done. Sometimes it seems like I’m good at everything, great at nothing — but it’s been fun to dabble in different areas, and I feel so much more prepared for the real-world where anything can happen. Looking back, sometimes I think I should have cut student government or some other activity, but those extracurriculars made me happy, made me a better communicator, and made me a better leader — and looking back, I wouldn’t change that for anything.
My grandparents instilled a sense of pride and hardwork in my mother and her sister, and that has been passed on to me (and my brother, to an extent.) Though I grew up in a comfy area, something I’ve realized is that there’s a reason for that. My mom knows how to save money. We don’t go shopping much, but when we do, it’s often thrift shopping and sales (I used to be ashamed of this, but now I say it loud and proud — I GOT THESE LULULEMON PANTS THAT LOOK LIKE NEW FOR THE SAME PRICE AS TWO PUMPBO MILK TEAS FROM TPUMPS.) We go to Costco for groceries, and don’t go out to restaurants much. Hell, I shop and eat out so much less than my friends do, bringing my own snacks, drinks, and food to the movies, games, events, and even when they go to restaurants (I know it’s rude, but I do instead order a drink or appetizer— and after working in a restaurant, I do tip because I can emphasize!) It can get pretty awkward sometimes, but it is just not something I am willing to compromise on because I feel that spending money on food is somewhat petty because it just disappears right away.

Race and class are related, and I’m so grateful my school hosted this event because it made me reflect so much on where I’ve come from, as well as where I’m going. </p>
