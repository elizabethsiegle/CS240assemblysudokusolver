                    <p>I’ve been a She++ College Ambassador since October, and have loved every second of it. She++ is a Stanford non-profit that encourages women and girls to learn and pursue computer science and other technical fields, and as an Ambassador, I’ve represented them by organizing events under their name.
First, there was the Code Day (see previous Medium post.) Then, a few weeks ago, I organized a trip for Bryn Mawr and Haverford students to visit Google NYC. Baldwin high school students also almost attended, but were busy with midterms at the time. The NYC trip was stressful because so many people dropped out last minute, but it was so inspiring, educational, and fun for all. Though I’d already been to the NYC and MTV offices, it was the panel that really taught me (and my classmates) about what it’s like working in industry, working for a startup versus a big company, and more. </p>
<p>
This Summit and Gala was the icing on the cake, and what all this work had been leading up to. I’d been looking forward to it since the very beginning in October, as had been my grandmother. I didn’t go home for Spring Break because the tennis team went to Orlando, so it was amazing to see her, even if it was only for a few hours Saturday and Sunday. It’s funny because the reason I was able to see her (and my grandfather, for the last time) in the Fall was because of Cal Hacks and their travel reimbursement!
I flew in from Philly, with a layover in Chicago, early Wednesday morning. I had pulled an all-nighter the night before trying to finish my lab and because I was so afraid I’d miss my flight! As soon as all the Ambassadors got to Stanford, we went to VMWare and then Medallia in Palo Alto. </p>

<p>At first, things were sort of awkward. All of us had connected on Facebook, giving advice and talking about the events we were organizing, and then were thrown (or flown) together to meet face-to-face. Slowly, we bonded over our shared passions for computer science and diversity, realizing that though we were so different, we had much in common. Tough classes and labs, being the minority in a classroom (I was quiet on this part,) internship and research problems, and more. VMWare exceeded all expectations. The campus and people were great, and we mingled for about an hour with engineers. I talked the whole time with Anita, a PM, and learned so much about program and product management. Then, we headed over to Medallia. Their office was smaller, but still wonderful. We met in this Oval-Office-styled room, and had a sort of round table with women engineers and executives. </p>
<p>
The next day, we visited Google and Facebook, merging our group of 12 College Ambassadors with about 30 high school fellows. Though I’d already been to Google multiple times, I enjoyed the panel, and went to the Visitors’ Center, which I had yet to visit. Next, at Facebook, was when we talked with the Head of Diversity, Maxine Williams. She was amazing, eloquent, and relatable, commanding the respect and rapt attention of the entire room. The panel at Facebook also was great because it had a Wellesley alumna! Up until then, so many of the panelists had been from Stanford — which was great, but none of the Ambassadors were from there. We talked about women’s colleges, the liberal arts, and overcoming imposter syndrome. I hope to keep in touch with her! (Also, everyone got a large pink or blue poster which said Be the Nerd, which was a nod to when Zuckerberg told a girl to step up and be one, gender stereotypes and norms begone.) Though I loved Facebook when I visited Yangfan there with the SGHack50 team, it was great to see it with my fellow Ambassadors and the HS Fellows.
</p>
<p>
On the final day, we made the long trek from Sunnyvale to San Francisco to visit Pinterest and Square. I enjoyed seeing Pinterest more in depth than when I had stopped by to pick up swag for the Code Day in January, and there was a panel there as well. I saw my recruiter, which was neat, too. At Square, there was also Gloria, from Code Day! She, Alyssa Pohahau, and some other women engineers were the greatest. They showed us around, spoke about their experiences on a panel, and had lunch with us. After Square, we headed to the Golden Gate Bridge. As a local, I was the token photographer for the other Ambassadors, which was cool.
</p>
<p>
After SF, we were back at the hotel to get ready for the Gala. My mom stopped by to pick up my suitcase and drop off my dress and heels. She had gotten this great dress (originally over $100 at Nordstrom) for $7 at Goodwill and had tried it on, guessing it would also fit me (what even is the college/CS 20? LOL). The dress was amazing, and the Gala was fun. Just fun, though. I enjoyed catching up with people from SMHS, people I’d met at hackathons, some of the Spectra (NorCal’s largest female hackathon, coming to you this summer) marketing team, and Umika, a friend who had been at Bryn Mawr with me. I talked to sponsors, engineers, and thanked Meraki, who chose me and one other Ambassador to “sponsor.” I hope to visit them this summer, as they’re fairly close to PubNub, where I’ll be interning, as well as the ballpark.
At the Gala, there were plenty of engineers, executives, students, and random people from the public! It was pretty neat, but I felt that the Ambassadors could have done more. We kind of just sat and stood there, while the High School Fellows talked about their projects with posters. </p>
<p>
Once we left the Gala and the Computer History Museum (which I liked a lot better when I wasn’t insanely stressed like at Hack the Planet last August), we had In ‘N Out at the hotel! In the wise words of Riley Curry, “Waaay up, I feel blessed!” The Ambassadors stayed up late talking in one of our rooms, and I’m sad we had to part ways. </p>
<p>
The next morning, I bolted from our hotel in Sunnyvale to UC Berkeley. I stopped by #baybithack , talked to some sponsors, but did not hack. I didn’t need that stress, and didn’t have the time! I visited Elise and we worked together on work in the student center. Kristie came later, and it was great to catch up with both of them, even though it was only for a short amount of time because I had to run back into the city to see my grandmother! </p>
<p>
Po Po was in awe that this was the third time I traveled across the country for something computer science-related! (Bank of America Tech Summit in NYC, Cal Hacks aka the surprise over Fall Break, and now this.) We’d both been looking forward to this time since I stayed with her over winter break for my externship. I enjoyed making the trek from Embarcadero Station up California Street again — so scenic, fresh air, and home. I saw her again the next morning for Dim Sum (of course), and then went to Costco, Target, and the Hillsdale Mall. I bought some snacks and gifts for my last She++ event, and enjoyed just walking around my hometown. </p>
<p>
Though brief and action-packed, this was a great trip. I loved my fellow Ambassadors, the HS Fellows (though they were sometimes annoying ;) ), the Stanford students, and my family. I loved playing tourist and networking, and I learned so much about what I want to do, where I want to work, and how to get there. I hope to bring what I learned back with me to Bryn Mawr and Haverford, and finish the semester strong. After all, I’ll be back in a month and a half!
