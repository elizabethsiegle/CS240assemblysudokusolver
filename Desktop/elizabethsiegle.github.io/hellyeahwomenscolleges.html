                    <p>
                    Recently, there have been a lot of prospective students on campus. Seeing them brings me back to a little over a year ago, when I was looking at colleges; this, in return, got me thinking as to why I chose to come to a small women’s college across the country instead of a UC, or Grinnell in Iowa, or Scripps in Claremont (my other top choices), especially when my twin brother chose a UC. </p>
                    <p>
Growing up, I was a tomboy. I played eight different sports throughout middle school, followed professional sports religiously, and preferred comfort to cuteness for the first thirteen years of my life. I was comfortable with friends of both genders, thanks to having a twin brother my whole life, and loved shooting hoops or kicking a ball around with guys. Why on Earth would I choose a women’s college? </p>
<p>
I’ve always been determined, setting more goals than I could reach and shooting for the moon. Yet I realized that some people treated my twin brother differently than me, almost expecting more of him than me, making naive assumptions and broad gender stereotypes even in this 21st century. Luckily, I learned the benefits of the single-sex atmosphere firsthand right around the time I was looking at colleges, and I wish others will do the same. </p>
<p>
Lesson #1: Get a diverse group of girls of different ages and backgrounds together and they will bond and grow. </p>
<p>
I started playing tennis late in life for a competitive junior player. I tried it out at fourteen because my mom thought I was too short for volleyball and basketball, which I was playing at the time. I enjoyed tennis enough, so I kept at it, making the varsity team as a freshman, playing #2 doubles, and later 2 singles as a sophomore. Wanting to take it to the next level, I attended an all-girls diversity camp sponsored by USTA Northern California. While all of the coaches were honestly the best coaches I’ve ever had, (shoutout to Francisco and Edgar!) the most inspirational was Loke, the then-coach at her alma mater, Mills College, a small women’s college in Oakland, CA. She honed my backhand faster than I thought possible, but more importantly, she was kind, thoughtful, engaging, understanding, smart, and strong. Seeing her instruct the other girls and talking to her each day in that group setting drove me to consider women’s colleges. Besides wanting to be like Coach Loke, I was fascinated at the effects I saw from this all-female environment. At the start, all the campers were strangers to each other, but after four days, we had grown as a group, bonding together on and off the court. One of the girls (she’s also a ball girl with me at Bank of the West Classic) is still one of my closest friends, and I tell almost everything to her, even though she’s twoyears younger; the others I keep in touch with on social media. The coaches (and some of the campers, later) pulled me aside on the last day of camp and told me I, as one of the older campers, had inspired them (the younger girls). Similar instances occur all the time at women’s colleges because there’s something about being surrounded by girls so different and yet so similar at the same time. It’s perhaps the most empowering feeling ever. Each day, I am inspired to work harder, do more, and I am encouraged and supported in all that I do. It’s…amazing. I feel like I can do whatever I set my mind to. </p>
<p>
Lesson #2: Role models. Role models everywhere.  </p>
<p>
I myself always had a strong female role model around me. There was my mom, with her harrowing tales of being the lone woman in public accounting, and being mistaken for a secretary. There was my fit and cool aunt. There were my cousins who got PhD’s in biology and computer science. I read numerous library books about Hillary Clinton, Billie Jean king, Mulan, Joan of Arc, Babe Didrikson, and the whole American Girl series (hey, they were educational — I was so prepared for APUSH junior year!) Yet, still I felt there weren’t enough strong female role models. </p>

<p>
Around a year ago, I decided to take a day off from my weekend job and miss a big track meet to attend (after applying and getting accepted to) an all-day free coding camp put on by Stanford women computer science majors called Girls Teaching Girls to Code. I applied, thinking it’d be interesting, but not seriously considering it as a major or field of study. About 90 girls attended and there must have been about 15 mentors. Though I signed up for specific lessons, which included code breaking and app development, I honestly don’t remember much of it. I only remember how I felt at the end of the long day, and it had nothing to do with my swag bag stuffed with neat tech gear. I only remember the diverse group of mentors and how they broke every stereotype I had about computer programmers: they were pretty, athletic, perky, friendly, and, well, normal! They reminded me of me and my friends, except for the fact that A) they went to Stanford And B) I officially thought they were Goddesses because they were programmers. They honestly didn’t teach me much in that short amount of time, but they showed me that majoring in computer science was relevant, interesting, a door-opener, and, more importantly, attainable. That summer, I got a job as a cashier in a takeout restaurant located close to a few tech startups. I chatted with the many computer engineers, most of whom were male, trying to learn about their backgrounds, what they did, and what I could do. I did lessons on Codecademy, and, on one engineer’s suggestion, Coursera. I attended Women who Code meetups (at 18, I was too old for Girls who Code but hell yes I still made a bracelet through Google’s Made with Code!) </p>
<p>
Lesson #3 (linking lessons #1 and 2): a life inspired inspires others </p>
<p>
As a Roger Federer ad once said, a life inspired inspires others. The tennis girls inspired me too, as I saw how hard they worked. Seeing one of the group struggling and persevering before overcoming, shows you that anything is possible, and that if they can do it, so can you. That camp and that group changed me, driving me to inspire other girls by coaching, tutoring, and umpiring young girls in sports and school.
Similarly, Girls Teaching Girls to Code (and later, but less so, Women who Code) drove me to want to defy stereotypes. That summer, all the big tech companies published their diversity numbers, highlighting the lack of women and minorities in engineering and higher positions. Even though women have made much progress, there’s still a long way to go. Statistics show that women’s colleges create leaders, create successful, confident, strong women poised to take on the world head-on. </p>
<p>
I wrote a paper about the benefits of women’s colleges junior year of high school and only last semester, and some highlights are below: </p>
<p>
Side by Side: The Relevance of Modern-Day Women’s Colleges, and Why They Succeed in Catapulting Women to the Top </p>
<blockquote>
“It is past time for women to take their rightful place, side by side with men, in the rooms where the fates of peoples, where their children’s and grandchildren’s fates, are decided.”
–Hillary Clinton, Wellesley College class of 1969</blockquote>
<p>
After attending a women’s college, alumnae are more likely to go on to graduate school, direct a big business, or lead in politics. Many famous “first females” honed their skills at women’s colleges. Selena Rezvani, author of The Next Generation of Women Leaders: What You Need to Lead but Won’t Learn in Business School, points out this interesting statistic in “Are Women’s Colleges Still Needed?”: What’s more, while women’s college graduates make up only a small minority of the college-educated population, one-third of the women board members of the Fortune 1000 companies are women’s college graduates, and women’s college graduates are twice as likely to earn Ph.D.s., more often going on to study the sciences and attend medical school. Of Business Week’s list of rising women stars in corporate America, 30 percent are women’s college graduates and of women members of Congress, 20 percent attended women’s colleges. </p>

<p>

Susan Scrimshaw adds onto that statement in “Yes to Women’s Colleges:”
Although only 2 percent of all women who attended a US college or university in the past 30 years were graduates of women’s colleges… they constitute…nearly 20 percent of the 2005 Fortune “50 Most Powerful Women in Business.” </p>
<p>
These facts show the success of women’s schools in preparing their students to thrive, and succeed. The all-female environment must have fostered something in these bourgeoning women to get them to their current position, and that something is a desire to learn and advance, a voice in the back of their heads telling them to go that extra mile. Female pioneers like Katharine Hepburn, Martha Stewart, Barbara Bush, Betty Friedan, Julia Child, Gloria Steinem, Nancy Pelosi, Pearl Buck, Madeline Albright, and many other women’s college alumnae received that hunger, as women’s college graduates are likelier to go onto higher education and more prestigious jobs than those from their coed college counterparts. In her article “Why all Colleges Should Think of Themselves as Women’s Colleges”, Wellesley president H. Kim Bottomly agreed:
In the last century, women tore down some enormous barriers — and it’s no coincidence that many of the women who led the way are graduates of women’s colleges. Two of the three female U.S. Secretaries of State, Hillary Clinton and Madeleine Albright, went to Wellesley. Gloria Steinem and Jane Harman graduated from Smith. At the time, they received the kind of academic preparation that was then primarily reserved for men.
Women’s colleges continue to attract women who are unafraid to stand out or stand up for their beliefs, breaking down gender barriers and defying stereotypes in the process of learning and working. These women’s college graduates then inspire so many young girls to do the same, who then empower the next generation of little girls. As it is evident that women’s colleges have inspired so many bold young women to make a difference in the world, they should maintain their single-sex status and be a more popular option for prospective students today. </p>
<p>
Do I sometimes wish I were going to a coed college? Yes, I miss talking sports with people who care about sports, and sometimes I miss the male perspective. Do I think I’ll miss out on that stereotypical college experience, filled with football/basketball games, tailgating, and big parties? Minus the tailgating and big parties, yes. Because I’m taking two courses at nearby coed Haverford College this semester, can eat in their dining hall, and go to their events and parties, that will suffice until I’m back home with my twin brother and his friends.I am making plans to go to Villanova during March Madness, too, to get my exciting basketball fix. Even though I can’t experience some of these things, I still can’t believe how happy I am here. I can go to a coed party, then come back to my safe haven and talk about everything and anything with sisters. I’ll take empowerment, old traditions, passionate people, leadership positions, and dismantling the patriarchy any day. </p>
