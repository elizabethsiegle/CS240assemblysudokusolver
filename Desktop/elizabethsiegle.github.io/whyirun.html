                    Why do I run? I’ve never been slow, but I never considered myself semi-fast until I won my age group in my first 10k last year. I only started cross country in seventh grade, and ran track junior and senior years of high school, as conditioning for basketball and tennis, as something I had to do. I never took it too seriously because my brother used to be the runner, he was the one track and cross country coaches compared me too. I was the slow sister, the one they put up with because they got the star (boy) runner. His mile time was 6:26 in 6th grade, and that’s roughly my best time after 2 track seasons. </p>
                    <p>
I remember the first week of cross country in 2008, and faking stomach cramps to get out of intervals. At the time, I was happy to get out of running. However, shortly after, I didn’t like that idea of my quitting before something was completed. That was the first and last time I stopped in the middle of running before I was done. Since then, running hasn’t become easier, I’ve just grown stronger, mentally and physically. </p>
<p>
People ask me why I enjoy sweating, pumping arms, and running long distance (6–8 miles). For one, I don’t have the body of a short distance sprinter. Comparing the two, I see it as do you want your pain short and intense or long and drawn-out? Secondly, though my mile has gone from 6:23 to roughly 7 minutes in a year (shoutout to my track coaches Michon and Riley for getting it to under 6:25, credit to dining hall food for getting it back up), I still love the feel of air on my face, the calm pitter-patter of my shoes thumping the pavement, the rhythmic motion of my body. Though my form isn’t “correct,” it works for me. Most importantly, however, running represents life. You will encounter hills and pits, highs and lows, fast times and slow. When you’re on the first mile of a 10k, you never think that you’ll be able to finish it. I get out-of-breath after running for a few minutes! Yet I tell myself to keep going, to just go a half mile more. Then, when I reach that, I tell myself to go another half mile. And another. And one more. I tell myself to make it to that tree, to finish the song, to make it to the stoplight ahead. It is amazing how I can always go further than I thought possible at one time. </p>

<p>
If I’m having a bad day, I go for a run to clear my mind. If I am unable to make my program run or understand a math problem or if a writing assignment is irking me, I take a running break to clear my mind. I prefer running outdoors back home, running around town, to the library, the bank, or my friend’s house in San Mateo. I love having a destination and seeing cars and trees whizz by. Here, at Bryn Mawr, the weather has not permitted me to exercise outside — and surprisingly, I’ve found the treadmill to be fun as well. I like having a set pace that keeps me on track, pushing me. I like setting an incline or having specific intervals. It’s not the same as being outside, which I still prefer, but it has its benefits. </p>
<p>
Overall, running has pushed me to be a better person. It’s taught me persistence, and showed me that I can finish anything. When things seem grim, I lace up my purple Mizunos and hit the pavement. Its given me goals, like running the Nike SF Women’s Half, or Run Disney events. It’s helped me with school, helped me meet people (there’s something uniting about making eye contact with a fellow sweaty person with that similar facial expression of grit and determination.) Running is not about the destination, it’s about the journey — a sweaty, hard-fought, tiring one that is different, yet inspiring and enlightening, each time. As a banner in the Bryn Mawr gym says, “Smart Women Strong Women.” </p>
