                    <p>This past summer, I applied for many technical internships, even though I knew they were difficult to get as freshmen (and I’d only been coding for a year.) I was disappointed anyways when I didn’t land one, but knew that I would use my time wisely to make money and also teach myself new skills. (While still having fun. More on that down below.) </p>
                    <p>
I won’t elaborate on my Algebra Teaching Assistant position because you can read more about that in another post (Letter to Students), except I will say that that job taught me how experiences can create passion, and passion will drive you to do crazy (but wonderful) things. I found myself crying, thinking about how badly I wanted do something more for some of the students I met, and worked to create edify101.org. I dropped what I was learning at the time to focus on that, because I so strongly wanted to do more, to do something good. </p>
<p>
Though I’d taught myself basic web design last summer, and had done front-end at three hackathons (one in January, two this summer), I got so much better by working on (and failing sometimes at) this project. I put in many an hour trying to make a login and registration system (with skills that I picked up at Piazza Hack) and was frustrated when it didn’t work. In that frustration, I ended up wasting time — but in the end, I learned about static websites, different hosting, and just so much that I can’t even begin to describe it all. Edify101 reinforced my Node.JS, Socket.IO, and mongoDB experience that I had seen in place at Piazza Hack, even though the current site doesn’t use that code I wrote. </p>
<p>
Speaking of failures…I attended three hackathons. The first one, SG50 Hack, was my favorite. I’d been teaching myself iOS development (this was pre-Edify101), and it really showed there when I did a lot of the work on our app. (Normally I wouldn’t feel comfortable saying this as it seems egotistic, but read on — and you’ll see how my pride didn’t last.)
At Piazza, I felt like I failed. At Piazza, I did basic front-end and wrote a few lines of Node.JS, but still felt lost when looking at the back-end part. I joined that team last minute because mine fell apart moments before hacking started, and I liked this team’s idea. I’m fortunate that David and Purag were so great and inspiring and helpful, though, that they accepted me and helped me learn. They patiently explained different processes, concepts, and technologies that they’d learned over the years and during the first year at UCSD. So, even though I felt like I failed, I contributed more front-end, and learned a little JavaScript, Node, and new tech, which I am now more comfortable with — so, I’m better for it, for getting out of my comfort zone. </p>
<p>
I brought up comfort zones because I was out of mine for most of this summer. People think I’m super good now because I went to all these events, (I attended Hack the Planet fairly last minute since they had openings and I didn’t need travel reimbursement to Montain View) — BUT I went to them in order to learn, gain experience, immerse myself in the culture and new technologies, and to meet amazing people. </p>
<p>
Were some people intimidating? Hell yes. I didn’t know so many people could have begun coding at age 7 or 13! Do I feel behind? I repeat, hell yes. The more I learn, the more I realize I do not know. And yet I’m still encouraged and still motivated. I’ve seen what other students can do, and I’ve seen what I can do. I’ve seen the positive impacts of technology, and how empowering it is to be able to do something yourself (as shown by that Facebook poster — nothing is anyone’s else’s business but your own).
</p>
<p>
I also completely revamped this site/blog. I’ve realized that this, and Edify101, will never be done. They will always be works in progress, always be things that I can work on to improve and make better. It’s frustrating, but I kind of like that — always changing, always growing. (You better get that Pocahontas reference.) </p>
<p>
I also learned that some friends are forever. Time and distance actually makes us closer sometimes. I also learned not to judge people (I already knew this, but still.) When asking people to mentor for Edify101, I didn’t expect some to actually sign up and be interested. It’s peculiar how different aspects of the project may resonate with some, and how some who I expected to help a lot are not at all into it. </p>
<p>
Concerned friends and family wondered if I had free time or fun time. And yes, I did, thank you very much. I reread each Harry Potter book, watched a lot of movies, went to Disneyland with my family, went to Tahoe for a weekend with Andrea and Elise, was a ballgirl again, had a spontaneous day in New York City (after being flown there for a Bank of America Tech Summit!), visited a friend/SGHack teammate at Facebook, and taught tennis lessons everyday for a month. I loved working with this one 5th grade girl because she wanted the lessons, and not her parents. She was the quickest learner I’ve worked with in a while. She inspired me, and I can only hope I did the same. </p>
<p>
This summer didn’t go according to plan. I didn’t learn everything I wanted to, I didn’t see everyone I discussed meeting up with, and I spent a lot of time Googling how to do things while sitting on my butt. Nevertheless, I’ve grown. I’ve learned. I’ve met new people, and we still keep in touch. (For now…). And I wouldn’t change a thing, because I’m refreshed and recharged for a tough, but fun, sophomore year and tennis season.
