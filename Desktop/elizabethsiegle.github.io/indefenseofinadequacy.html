                        First things first — shout-out to CalHacks for funding half of my trip home for Fall Break.
                    </p>
                    <p>
Seeing my grandparents’ faces when I surprised them with a visit (they didn’t think I’d be back until December) Friday morning made everything worth it — those sleepless nights, the stress, the mini breakdowns. </p>
</p>Regarding my defense of inadequacy…for the past year, I’ve felt inadequate at hackathons. At Yale-Hack a year ago, I didn’t make anything. Some classmates and I sat in a room, worked on homework and a lab, got free swag, and went to some workshops. During the demo, it was so intimidating to walk up to different groups and see what they’d built — and yet, it was inspiring too. </p>
<p>
At Tri-Co Hackathon, there was one other freshman there — and she was on my team. It was intimidating at team formation time to talk to all of these Haverford and Swarthmore guys who seemed so good. Yet — some were so helpful during the hackathon — it was inspiring.
At SGHack50 in July, I felt more at home (and not just because it was in SF.) It was intimidating being surrounded by all of these grown-looking Asian men, but I felt more like a hacker this time. Maybe it was the past two hackathons under my belt, maybe it was because I loved my group, maybe it was because I understood more tech terminology, maybe it was my completion of Data Structures and Discrete Math the semester before — or probably all of the above. It was a great feeling, especially after feeling intimidated before. </p>
<p>
At Piazza Hack and Hack the Planet, though I felt somewhat comfortable, I still felt inadequate! Piazza Hack seemed to be home to so many tech interns who knew so much, and Hack the Planet brought together hackers who had been to the most MLH-sanctioned events. But guess what? When I feel less smart or experienced, I feel out of my comfort zone. And do you know where magic happens? Outside that zone. That is where I ask questions, take risks, make mistakes, grow, and learn. That is where I realize that it is okay not to know something (or everything.) For the most part, usually, there’ll be someone or multiple people who are kind enough to take me under their wing, mentor me, and help me. And then, later, I can be that person. It’s a great feeling to see how far I’ve come since my first hackathon, how much I now understand (and don’t understand), and how now I can be a mentor. I can help others like I’ve been helped. And this wouldn’t have happened (at least so soon) if I hadn’t been less experienced, less knowledgeable, and less, well, good, than my peers. </p>
<p>
In classes, sometimes I think, “What am I doing here? I was a Humanities person in high school! Sometimes, I’d rather be in an English class. I think I want to be a high school computer science teacher, and some of you will be working for Google or something.” But it’s still inspiring. Ultimately, most classmates want to change the world, or have an impact. They’re smart, hardworking, supportive, and helpful. Seniors understand what we’re going through because they’ve done it before. I’m still learning, I’m still growing, because of them. And for that, I’m grateful. </p>
<p>
Moral of the story? Challenge yourself. Surround yourself with people who are smarter than you. I read this quote about how you should never be the smartest one in the room. And, thanks to my experiences, I agree with that wholeheartedly. </p>
